# Majora's Mask: Recompiled Modern Controller Overhaul Mod

A Zelda64Recomp mod that aims to overhaul the HUD and UI surrounding the game's control scheme in order to align it as closely as possible with modern controllers.

It does this through repositioning HUD elements, replacing text and textures mentioning control schemes, and fixing inconsistencies and bugs with the original game.

Requires [EZ Text Replacer API](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/).
