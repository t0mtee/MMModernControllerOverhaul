This mod includes textures for Nintendo controllers, and I have made textures for:

- Xbox / ROG Ally
- PlayStation
- Steam Deck
- 8BitDo

which are all included in this repo and the Thunderstore MCO download.
The message textures in all of these assume that the Attack button is the down button and the Action button is the up button.

I highly encourage people to make and upload textures for their own button layout!
If you use the textures in this repo as a template, you are required to upload the edited source textures to your own repo and give credit to me, pizza1398 (if you use the pause menu switcher textures), Nerrel, and GhostlyDark (who made the textures that I used as a base).

Community made textures:
- Pizza Glyphs: pizza1398 on Discord has taken the time to make some more art-style consistent empty button glyphs for ABXY, BAYX, and DualShock controllers:

Tips when making textures:
- I have sometimes left notes in the .xcfs as to how I achieved consistent shading and feathering across different textures.
- Remember to always export with the option "Save color profile" enabled.
