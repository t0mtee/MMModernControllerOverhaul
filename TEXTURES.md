This mod includes textures for Nintendo controllers, and I have made texture packs for:

- Xbox / ROG Ally
- DualShock
- Steam Deck
- Controllers with just L2 and R2, like some 8BitDo controllers.

which are all included in this repo and the main Thunderstore MCO download.

The message textures in all of these assume that the Attack button is the down button and the Action button is the up button - if you use a different control scheme, you'll have to modify the texture pack yourself.
1. Download the textures from this repo.
2. Compare your control scheme to the default one - which buttons did you move? Maybe write down which buttons you swapped to help you remember them.
3. Find the textures for the buttons you originally moved - if they have a corresponding texture for the button you swapped them with, simply rename the files so they swap names.
4. If there isn't a corresponding texture, you may have to manually edit the textures yourself.
5. Pack the textures [like any other RT64 texture pack](https://github.com/rt64/rt64/blob/main/TEXTURE-PACKS.md) and place them in your mods folder.

Tips when making textures:
- I have sometimes left notes in the .xcfs as to how I achieved consistent shading and feathering across different textures.
- Remember to always export with the option "Save color profile" enabled.

I highly encourage people to upload their custom button layout textures!
If you use the textures in this repo as a template, you are required to upload the edited source textures to your own repo and give credit to me, pizza1398 (if you use the pause menu switcher textures), Nerrel, and GhostlyDark (who made the textures that I used as a base).

Community made textures:
- Pizza Glyphs: pizza1398 on Discord has taken the time to make some more art-style consistent empty button glyphs:
