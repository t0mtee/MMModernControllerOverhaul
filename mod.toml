Uses HD textures. I've made some low-res textures, but they're not complete - I don't have much desire to complete them either as I use MM Reloaded.

Credit to Nerrel and GhostlyDark for the base of most of the HD textures.

I'll happily take contributions to improve textures! Contact me on Discord (tomtee_) or open a PR on Github.
